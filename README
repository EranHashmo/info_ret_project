Title: Simple Search Engine

Author: EranHashmo

Description:
This project is part of the Information Retrieval course in The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
It is a relatively simple search engine for reviews supplied by the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).

Note that this project is currently not working well and I will be fixing and tweaking it during the following months.
